# Computer Vision Course

This Computer Vision Course was offered by Udemy, titled "Python for Computer Vision," and taught by Jose Portilla.

## Skills Learned During the Course:
- Understand basics of NumPy
- Manipulate and open images with NumPy
- Use OpenCV to work with image files
- Use Python and OpenCV to draw shapes on images and videos
- Perform image manipulation with OpenCV, including smoothing, blurring, thresholding, and morphological operations
- Create color histograms with OpenCV
- Open and stream video with Python and OpenCV
- Detect objects, including corner, edge, and grid detection techniques with OpenCV and Python
- Create face detection software
- Segment images with the Watershed Algorithm
- Track objects in video
- Use Python and Deep Learning to build image classifiers
- Work with TensorFlow, Keras, and Python to train on your own custom images

### Personal Project Applications
The skills learned during the course were quite beneficial to me in my personal projects related to Pupil Detection, and Screen Tracking.
