# Computer Vision Course 
<br>
This Computer Vision Course was offered by Udemy. The name of the course is "Python for Computer Vision" taught by Jose Portilla.
<br>
Skills learnt during the course are:
->Understand basics of NumPy
->Manipulate and open Images with NumPy
->Use OpenCV to work with image files
->Use Python and OpenCV to draw shapes on images and videos
->Perform image manipulation with OpenCV, including smoothing, blurring, thresholding, and morphological operations.
->Create Color Histograms with OpenCV
->Open and Stream video with Python and OpenCV
->Detect Objects, including corner, edge, and grid detection techniques with OpenCV and Python
->Create Face Detection Software
->Segment Images with the Watershed Algorithm
->Track Objects in Video
->Use Python and Deep Learning to build image classifiers
->Work with Tensorflow, Keras, and Python to train on your own custom images.
<br>
Overall the skills learnt during the course were quite benificial to me in my personal projects related to Pupil Detection, and Screen Tracking.
